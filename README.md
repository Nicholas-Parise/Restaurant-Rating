# Restaurant rating app

## Overview
A spin on letterboxd with a similar design language that emphasizes real reviews and a close knit community. Make an account, leave reviews, see what people you know have given the restaurant and find people who share a similar taste to you! 

### Problem
Reviews are dominated by the big restaurant / service review sites like Google reviews and Yelp, but they are not personal and are dry and flavorless so I want a service that makes people want to use it like Letterboxd. Just like how Letterboxd stole the users from rotten tomatoes and IMDB I want to do the same with my service.

### Objective
Make a service that is simple to use that has the features people actually want while fostering a community of like minded people.
